For Omnis Studio 8.1.2 and above.

The sqlworker.db file contains the data and needs to be placed at the same level as the imported library.

## Contents
### SQLWorker
This folder contains the source JSON files for the Omnis library in Github. 

To restore these files in Omnis Studio, click on the Libraries option in the Studio Browser, and click on the New Lib from JSON option. In the New Library (import) dialog, navigate to this source folder (containing library.json), and then specify a different folder or location for the new Library. Click on Import and open the library in the Studio Browser. 

This library is available in the Hub in Omnis Studio but hosting it here allows you to download it, enhance it, and submit your changes here to share with other developers.
